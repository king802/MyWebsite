                                        <p><strong>Hello, my name is Max King!</strong> I discovered programming during
                                            the last few years of completing my undergraduate degree in mechanical
                                            engineering. I immediately fell in love and decided upon the completion of
                                            my degree to go back to school to get my master's in Computer Science.
                                            I have worked on all sorts of different projects since I found the world of
                                            computer science, and I decided to put this website together to try and
                                            capture that work and share it.
                                            <br/><br/>
                                            I have a wide range of interests, and I hope that this website can organize
                                            them and present them in a meaningful way. This website is primarily
                                            composed of programing projects that I have done in grad school and on my
                                            own. Though, I have added some other non-programming projects at the end,
                                            which helps conveys who I am.

                    <p>One of the things that I love about programming is that there are countless ways to get lost in
                        it. The following section is a break down of some of the work that I have done in only a few of
                        the computer science areas that have attracted me so far. Almost all of the code and work for
                        these projects are on my public

                        </a>
                        But unfortunately, some of them are not able to be public. If you have any questions about my
                        projects, please feel free to reach out, and I would be happy to discuss them with you.

                                                fascinating to me. The challenge of working with large datasets to

                                        <p><b>I also have a passion for solving puzzles with my hands.</b> Growing up, I
                                            did all sorts of different summer jobs. In high school, I spent some time
                                            working in the stonemason trade. I enjoyed the challenge that natural stone
                                            walls and patios provided. It was like trying to solve some of the world's
                                            hardest jigsaws. I have since done several projects on my own and continue
                                            to find different places to add in some natural stone scapes. Below are some
                                            photos of the work that I have done.</p><br/>
